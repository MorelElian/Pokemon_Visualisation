# Pokemon_Visualisation
The goal of this project is to provide insights about the pokemon dataset. 
To visualize this dataset, we mainly uses d3.js
## Prerequisites
This website need a local server to work correctly, else it cannot load the different scripts.
This project uses d3 and Bootstrap : in order to be run proprely you need to be connected to internet else the visualisation will be damaged
## Pokemons' Sprites
The Pokedex is better with images of the Pokemons. Unfortunately, the files are to huge to fit on GitHub
I have maid a we transfer link with all the Pokemons' sprite : if you want to have them, download the folder unzip it and places it into a folder img.
The structure should be the following : 
|src  
||data  
|||pokemons.csv  
||img  
|||gifs  
||||// PLACE HERE ALL THE GIFS  
||js   
|||all the js_files  
|| HTML FILES  
||Readme.md  

 ## Disclaimer 
 The website is not fully responsive yet, so if you want to have godd vizualisations, you need to run it on a computer.
